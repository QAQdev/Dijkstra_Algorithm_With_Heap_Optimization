* In main.cpp, macro __TEST_MODE__ is already defined, compiling only testing segment, testing files directly downloaded from http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml shall be put at the same directory as source code, and executables shall be in cmake-build-release or cmake-build-dubug directory.
* For default interactive user interface with ascii art logo, remove macro __TEST_MODE__ in main.cpp. When prompted to key in "src" or "ter", input -1 to quit current conversation. Please note conversations may be nested, consecutive -1 input may be required.
* Special reminder for macOS user,
	* before build, remove linker_flag in makefile document;
	* current directory should be changed to that with the working executable file in.
